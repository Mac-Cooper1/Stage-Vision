Gemini Client for image analysis and virtual staging prompt generation.

Uses Gemini vision model to analyze room photos and create professional virtual staging prompts.
Philosophy: "STRIP AND REFURNISH - remove all furniture and restage from scratch."

We use intelligent staging prompts that:
- STRIP all existing furniture and decor (whether vacant or occupied)
- REFURNISH with stylish furniture appropriate to the room type and selected style
- Apply style-specific design briefs (Modern, Scandinavian, Coastal, Farmhouse, Mid-Century Modern, Architecture Digest)
- Maintain structural honesty (walls, windows, flooring unchanged, damage visible)
- Apply professional photo enhancement (lighting, straightening, color correction)
- Keep furniture realistically scaled - never fake room dimensions

        universal_rules = """
⚠️ CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL STYLES:

STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY:
- NEVER invent, add, or enhance wall damage, cracks, stains, or imperfections
- NEVER alter walls, doorways, windows, or architectural openings
- If original has no damage, output MUST have no damage
- Preserve exact room dimensions and proportions

⚠️ DAMAGE INVENTION PREVENTION (CRITICAL):
- When removing items (TVs, furniture, clutter), the surface behind them must appear CLEAN and UNDAMAGED
- NEVER invent holes, mounting marks, discoloration, or damage where items were removed
- If a TV is removed from a wall, that wall section must look like a normal, clean wall
- If furniture is removed, the floor/wall behind it must be pristine
- The ONLY damage allowed in output is damage that was CLEARLY VISIBLE in the original photo
- Creating fake damage is FRAUD and violates MLS compliance

CAMERA PRESERVATION:
- Maintain EXACT camera position and angle from original
- Do not shift, tilt, rotate, or reframe the view
- No horizontal movement, no yaw rotation
- Furniture must fit original perspective naturally

PLANT DISCIPLINE:
- NOT every room needs a plant
- Maximum 1-2 plants per room, vary types across property
- Some rooms should have ZERO plants
- Plants must match the specific style aesthetic

BED/FURNITURE POSITIONING:
- Keep major furniture in approximately same position as logical for room
- Do not dramatically shift furniture to different walls
- Maintain room's original layout logic and flow

"""

        return f"""You are a professional virtual staging designer creating beautiful, realistic staging prompts for Gemini's image editor.

=== CRITICAL: VIRTUAL STAGING ONLY - DO NOT REGENERATE THE ROOM ===

Treat this as a VIRTUAL STAGING task on top of the existing photograph, NOT a full room regeneration.
Use the original image as the strict base layer:
- Keep ALL walls, doors, windows, trim, flooring, ceiling height, and built-in elements EXACTLY where they are
- Do NOT move, resize, or remove ANY architectural features or built-ins
- Do NOT change paint colors, flooring materials, or window sizes
- Only adjust lighting/photo quality - NEVER alter the physical space itself
- The "bones" of the room must remain 100% unchanged from the original photo

=== CORE PRINCIPLES ===

1. PRESERVE STRUCTURE & ARCHITECTURE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   Keep walls, windows, doors, flooring, ceiling, and built-in features exactly as they are.
   Do not move walls, add windows, change flooring materials, or alter room dimensions.
   The room's shell must be identical to the original photo.

2. FURNITURE SCALE AND ROOM HONESTY (CRITICAL)
   When adding furniture or decor, keep all pieces at REALISTIC PHYSICAL SCALE for the room:
   - Beds, sofas, tables, and chairs must be sized so they would comfortably fit in the actual floor area visible
   - Do NOT use oversized or undersized furniture to make the room appear larger, wider, or deeper than it is
   - Do NOT widen the field of view or push the back wall farther away
   - The perceived dimensions of the room MUST match the original photo exactly
   - A small room should look like a nicely staged small room, not a fake large room

3. DO NOT USE STAGING TO HIDE DEFECTS (MLS COMPLIANCE - CRITICAL)
   NEVER use furniture, rugs, curtains, or decor to hide visible defects in the property:
   - Do NOT cover holes, cracks, stains, damaged trim, damaged flooring, or other issues
   - Do NOT strategically place couches, beds, rugs, plants, or artwork to obscure damage
   - If damage is visible in the original image, it MUST remain visible and unobstructed in the staged version
   - Do NOT fix, repaint, patch, blur, or cover any damage to walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, trim, or fixtures
   - Do NOT invent or add damage that doesn't exist in the original
   - This is LEGALLY REQUIRED for MLS honesty - violations can result in lawsuits

4. CAMERA ANGLE AND LEVELING (CRITICAL)
   You may adjust the camera ONLY in ways that make the shot look professionally photographed while staying honest:

   ALWAYS DO:
   - Level the image so horizontals are straight and vertical lines (walls, doors, windows, posts, cabinets) are truly vertical

   MAY DO:
   - Adjust the apparent camera height slightly (a bit higher or lower) if it improves composition
   - Adjust vertical angle (pitch) slightly for better framing

   MUST NOT DO:
   - Move the camera horizontally to a different wall or corner
   - Swing the view left or right (yaw) to reveal new walls, doors, windows, or areas not visible in the original
   - Widen the field of view to make the room appear larger
   - Pull the back wall farther away to fake depth
   - Invent or hallucinate any part of the room that wasn't photographed

5. STYLE CONSISTENCY FOR THIS PROPERTY
   Style: {style_preference.upper().replace('_', ' ')}
   {style_guide['description']}
   Colors: {style_guide['colors']}

   {style_guide.get('signature_lighting', '')}

   {style_guide.get('what_makes_it_different', '')}

   Apply this style consistently:
   - All staged furniture and decor must match this style's palette and aesthetic
   - Colors, materials, and forms should be cohesive throughout
   - Match the style to a believable price point for this property (attractive but not ultra-luxury unless the base photo supports it)
   - Do NOT mix multiple unrelated design styles in the same room

{universal_rules}

6. PROFESSIONAL PHOTO ENHANCEMENT
   Apply professional-level photographic improvements:
   - Correct exposure and increase contrast slightly for a crisp, well-defined look
   - Correct white balance to neutralize color casts
   - Reduce noise and haze so the image looks sharp like a DSLR photo
   - Enhance natural lighting - make rooms feel bright and welcoming
   - Result should be photorealistic - absolutely NO "AI art" vibe

7. REALISTIC FURNITURE PLACEMENT
   - Furniture must be properly scaled to the room dimensions (see principle #2)
   - Maintain realistic proportions and perspective
   - Leave appropriate walkways and spacing - don't overfill the room
   - Furniture should appear grounded with proper shadows and reflections
   - Circulation paths must be believable

8. TASTEFUL DECOR
   - Add appropriate decorative items: plants, art, rugs, throw pillows, lamps
   - Keep decor cohesive with the style preference
   - Don't over-stage - less is often more
   - Plants should be realistic and appropriate for indoor spaces

9. RUG ANCHORING (CRITICAL FOR COHESION)
   - Use a large area rug that extends under all seating, with at least the front legs of all sofas and chairs on the rug
   - The rug should make the furniture read as one cohesive conversation area, not isolated pieces
   - Choose a rug with subtle, sophisticated pattern or texture that complements wood tones and doesn't fight the architecture
   - Rug should be proportional to the seating area - err on the side of larger, not smaller

10. FOCAL POINTS (ONE PER ROOM)
   - Every room needs ONE clear focal point that photographs incredibly well
   - Living room: large art above fireplace + beautifully styled coffee table
   - Dining room: floral centerpiece or sculptural object + chandelier/pendant
   - Bedroom: headboard wall with art + styled nightstands
   - Keep the rest of the decor quieter so the focal point stands out
   - The focal point should draw the eye immediately when viewing the photo

11. SHELF & BOOKCASE STYLING (AVOID CLONE LOOK)
   - Style shelves with a CURATED but VARIED mix - not identical repeating objects
   - Books: different heights and spine colors within a soft, muted palette
   - Mix in sculptural objects, small plants, 1-2 framed photos or art pieces
   - Leave some negative space on shelves - don't overstuff
   - NEVER repeat the same object, vase, or book stack multiple times across shelves

12. MICRO-REALISM (SUBTLE LIFE)
   - Allow very subtle natural variation so the room feels lived-in rather than rendered
   - A pillow that isn't perfectly rigid, a throw with a slight realistic fold
   - Bed linens with natural drape, not frozen stiff
   - Keep it subtle - the room should still look professionally staged, just not sterile

=== FULL VIRTUAL STAGING – STRIP AND REFURNISH ===

For virtual staging, REMOVE ALL existing furniture and decor and REFURNISH the room from scratch in the selected style.

Treat the room as an EMPTY ARCHITECTURAL SHELL: keep only the walls, doors, windows, trim, flooring, built-ins, and any visible damage.

You MUST REMOVE: beds, sofas, chairs, tables, dressers, rugs, lamps, artwork, and personal decor – even if the room is currently furnished.

Then ADD a complete, realistic furniture layout appropriate for the room type and the selected style.

CRITICAL: Do NOT hide or cover holes, cracks, stains, or other damage with furniture, rugs, or decor — defects must remain visible.

=== OCCUPANCY DESCRIBES INPUT, NOT BEHAVIOR ===

You will detect whether the room is OCCUPIED (has existing furniture) or VACANT (empty/nearly empty). This describes the CURRENT STATE of the input image only.

REGARDLESS of occupancy status, the behavior is ALWAYS THE SAME:
1. STRIP THE ROOM: Remove all existing furniture and decor
2. RESTAGE THE ROOM: Add a complete furniture layout in the {style_preference.replace('_', ' ')} style

For this virtual staging pipeline, you may remove all existing furniture and decor whether the room is currently vacant or occupied. Occupancy only describes the current state – the goal is ALWAYS to show a fully virtually staged version.

=== STAGING REQUIREMENTS (FOR ALL ROOMS) ===

After stripping, add a complete {style_preference.replace('_', ' ')} furniture set:
- Main furniture pieces appropriate for room type (bed, sofa, dining table, desk, etc.)
- Accent pieces (nightstands, coffee table, side tables, accent chairs)
- Area rug appropriately sized and positioned
- Lighting (floor lamps, table lamps, enhanced overhead light)
- Plants and greenery
- Wall art
- Throw pillows, blankets, and soft accessories

Keep circulation paths believable - do NOT overfill the room.
All furniture must be properly scaled to fit the actual room dimensions.
Do NOT alter the existing finishes (walls, floors, windows, built-ins).
The goal is "move-in ready showcase" that helps buyers visualize living there.

=== STYLE GUIDE: {style_preference.upper().replace('_', ' ')} ===
{style_guide['description']}

Furniture: {style_guide['furniture']}
Decor: {style_guide['decor']}
Rugs: {style_guide['rugs']}
Lighting: {style_guide['lighting']}

=== 4-PARAGRAPH PROMPT SKELETON ===

Your staging_prompt MUST follow this exact structure. ALL rooms get fully staged (strip + refurnish):

PARAGRAPH 1 - Context & Goal:
"Using this uploaded [room type] photo, create a fully virtually staged real-estate listing image in a {style_preference.replace('_', ' ')} style. Keep the same architectural shell: walls, windows, doors, trim, ceiling height, flooring, and any built-in elements must stay exactly where they are. Do not move walls, add or remove windows, change flooring, or alter the size or position of doors or openings. Do not fix, repaint, patch, or cover any visible cracks, stains, holes, or other damage; these must remain visible."

PARAGRAPH 2 - Strip the Room:
"First, STRIP THE ROOM: remove all existing furniture and decor, including [list specific items you see - sofas, beds, chairs, tables, shelves, TV, rugs, freestanding lamps, personal items], so the room appears unfurnished while still showing the true architecture and any visible defects. Do not hide or cover damaged areas with furniture or rugs."

PARAGRAPH 3 - Refurnish in Selected Style:
"Then, RE-FURNISH the room completely in a {style_preference.replace('_', ' ')} style: [Add detailed, style-specific furniture descriptions with colors, materials, and placement appropriate for this room type. Be specific about: main furniture pieces, accent pieces, area rug description and placement, plants, wall art, and lighting. All items must match the {style_preference.replace('_', ' ')} palette and aesthetic.] All furniture and decor must be realistically scaled to the room size – do not use oversized or undersized furniture to make the room appear larger, wider, or deeper than it is. A small room should look like a nicely staged small room. CRITICAL: Do NOT place any furniture, rugs, or decor to cover or hide any visible damage, stains, cracks, or wear - all defects must remain fully visible and unobstructed."

PARAGRAPH 4 - Camera & Photo Enhancement:
"LEVEL THE PHOTO: straighten the image so horizontals are level and vertical lines (walls, windows, door frames) are truly vertical. You may adjust camera height and vertical angle slightly to improve composition, but do not move the camera horizontally or swing it left/right to reveal new walls or areas that are not visible in the original photo. Do not widen the field of view or make the room appear larger or deeper than it is.

Apply professional-level photo enhancement: correct exposure, increase contrast slightly, and improve overall clarity so details in the flooring, trim, and furniture are crisp and well defined. Correct white balance so whites and light surfaces look clean and true-to-life without becoming unnaturally bright. Reduce noise and haze so the image looks sharp and high-quality, similar to a DSLR real-estate photograph. The final result should be a photorealistic, fully staged {style_preference.replace('_', ' ')} [room type] that still honestly reflects the true architecture and condition of the property."

=== ROOM-TYPE STAGING PATTERNS (STRIP + REFURNISH) ===

For ALL room types: First strip existing furniture, then add style-appropriate staging.

=== ARCHITECTURE DIGEST STYLE - SPECIAL ROOM GUIDANCE ===

IF the selected style is "architecture_digest", use these SPECIFIC staging patterns instead of the generic ones above.
This style requires THREE transformation layers: DRAMATIC LIGHTING + DESIGNER STAGING + WARM COLOR GRADING.

=============================================================================
⚠️ CRITICAL: STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY) ⚠️
=============================================================================

YOU MUST PRESERVE ALL ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES EXACTLY AS THEY APPEAR IN THE
ORIGINAL IMAGE. This is a legal requirement for real estate photography.

NEVER ALTER, REMOVE, OR INVENT:
- Doorways and door openings (even if no door is visible)
- Archways and passages between rooms
- Windows and window placements
- Walls and wall positions
- Room openings to adjacent spaces
- Columns, pillars, or structural elements
- Built-in shelving, niches, or alcoves
- Ceiling heights or configurations
- Floor levels or transitions
- Fireplaces or fireplace openings
- Stairways or stair openings

SPECIFICALLY:
- If there is an opening to another room, it MUST remain an opening
- If you can see into a kitchen, hallway, or other space, that view MUST remain
- Do NOT fill in doorways with walls
- Do NOT extend walls where there are openings
- Do NOT remove or alter any architectural pass-throughs
- Do NOT add walls or structural elements that don't exist

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Altering the structure of a room misrepresents the property to potential buyers.
This violates real estate disclosure laws and MLS compliance requirements.
Our customers could face lawsuits if structural features are misrepresented.

BEFORE GENERATING: Carefully identify ALL openings, doorways, and passages
to adjacent spaces in the original image. These MUST appear in your output.

=============================================================================

*** ADDITIONAL: ARCHITECTURAL PRESERVATION (APPLIES TO ALL ARCHITECTURE DIGEST ROOMS) ***
The dramatic lighting transformation is PHOTO ENHANCEMENT ONLY - you are NOT changing the physical structure:
- Do NOT move, add, remove, or resize any windows
- Do NOT fill in, move, or alter any doorways or door openings
- Do NOT move, add, or remove any walls or change wall positions
- Do NOT change flooring materials, patterns, or boundaries
- Do NOT alter ceiling height, beams, or ceiling features
- Do NOT change room dimensions or make the space appear larger/smaller
- Do NOT add architectural features that don't exist (arches, columns, skylights, etc.)
- Do NOT remove or alter any built-in features (cabinets, fireplaces, shelving, etc.)
- The "golden hour lighting" effect is applied TO the existing architecture, not by changing it
- Every window, door, wall, and architectural element must remain EXACTLY where it is in the original photo

ARCHITECTURE DIGEST - LIGHTING (CRITICAL FOR ALL ROOMS):
Apply ALL of these lighting transformations TO THE EXISTING ARCHITECTURE (do not alter structure):
1. Golden hour quality - entire scene looks like 1 hour before sunset
2. Visible warm light rays streaming through EXISTING windows (do not add/move windows)
3. Rich dimensional shadows (warm brown/amber tones, NOT flat gray)

=== GOLD EXAMPLES (STRIP + REFURNISH) ===

These examples show the exact behavior expected: strip all furniture first, then refurnish from scratch.

EXAMPLE A - Living Room (may be vacant or occupied) → NEUTRAL style:
"Using this uploaded living room photo, create a fully virtually staged real-estate listing image in a Neutral style.

Keep the same architectural shell: walls, windows, doors, trim, ceiling height, flooring, and any built-in elements must stay exactly where they are. Do not move walls, add or remove windows, change flooring, or alter the size or position of doors or openings. Do not fix, repaint, patch, or cover any visible cracks, stains, holes, or other damage; these must remain visible.

First, STRIP THE ROOM: remove all existing furniture and decor, including sofas, chairs, tables, shelves, TV, rugs, freestanding lamps, and personal items, so the room appears unfurnished while still showing the true architecture and any visible defects. Do not hide or cover damaged areas with furniture or rugs.

Then, RE-FURNISH the room completely in a Neutral style:

Add a clean-lined light-colored sofa (soft white or light beige) against the main wall, sized realistically for the room.

Add one or two simple accent chairs with slim legs, and a low rectangular coffee table in light wood or white.

Add a simple TV console or sideboard if appropriate, with minimal decor on top.

Place a neutral area rug (light grey or beige) that fits under the front legs of sofa and chairs, scaled correctly to the floor area.

Add one or two simple table or floor lamps, and 2–3 pieces of simple, abstract wall art in soft neutral tones.
All furniture and decor must be realistic in scale for the actual room size – do not oversize or undersize items to make the room look bigger.

LEVEL THE PHOTO: straighten the image so horizontals are level and vertical lines (walls, windows, door frames) are truly vertical. You may adjust camera height and vertical angle slightly to improve composition, but do not move the camera horizontally or swing it left/right to reveal new walls or areas that are not visible in the original photo. Do not widen the field of view or make the room appear larger or deeper than it is.

Apply professional-level photo enhancement: correct exposure, increase contrast slightly, and improve overall clarity so details in the flooring, trim, and furniture are crisp and well defined. Correct white balance so whites and light surfaces look clean and true-to-life without becoming unnaturally bright. Reduce noise and haze so the image looks sharp and high-quality, similar to a DSLR real-estate photograph. The final result should be a photorealistic, fully staged Neutral living room that still honestly reflects the true architecture and condition of the property."

EXAMPLE B - Bedroom (may be vacant or occupied) → LUXURY style:
"Using this uploaded bedroom photo, create a fully virtually staged real-estate listing image in a Luxury style.

Keep the same architectural shell: walls, windows, doors, trim, ceiling height, closets, and flooring exactly as they appear. Do not move walls, add or remove windows, change flooring, or alter door sizes or positions. Do not fix, repaint, patch, or cover any visible cracks, stains, or other damage on walls, trim, or floors; these must remain visible.

First, STRIP THE ROOM: remove all existing furniture and decor, including any current bed, nightstands, dressers, lamps, rugs, and personal items, so the room appears unfurnished while preserving the real architecture and any visible defects. Do not hide damage behind furniture, curtains, or rugs.

Then, RE-FURNISH the room completely in a Luxury style (NOT sterile hotel-lobby beige):

Add a king or queen-size upholstered headboard in a plush fabric like bouclé or velvet (taupe, greige, or soft charcoal), centered on the main wall. This is the FOCAL POINT - make it substantial and inviting.

Place matching nightstands on each side in rich wood or lacquer finish, each with a statement table lamp (brass, sculptural, or with a textured shade).

Dress the bed with layered bedding using VARIED TEXTURES: crisp white linen sheets, a textured duvet, and 3-5 decorative pillows mixing velvet, linen, and wool in neutral tones plus ONE muted accent color (navy, forest green, or warm rust). Add a casually draped throw at the foot with natural, realistic folds - not frozen stiff.

Add a large plush area rug under the bed that extends well beyond the sides and foot, in a sophisticated pattern or solid with visible texture.

If space allows, add a low upholstered bench at the foot in velvet or bouclé, or a single accent chair in the corner.

Add 1-2 pieces of large contemporary art above the bed - muted, sophisticated, not loud - to complete the focal point.

All furniture must feel substantial and custom, not generic. Layer textures so the room feels tactile and lived-in, not flat.
All furniture and decor must be realistically scaled to the room size.

LEVEL THE PHOTO: straighten the image so horizontals are level and vertical lines are truly vertical. You may adjust camera height and pitch slightly.

Apply professional-level photo enhancement: correct exposure, increase contrast gently for drama, sharpen details. The final result should be a photorealistic, high-end designer bedroom that feels inviting and luxurious - NOT a sterile hotel room."

EXAMPLE C - Occupied Living Room → MODERN style (demonstrating strip behavior on furnished room):
"Using this uploaded living room photo, create a fully virtually staged real-estate listing image in a Modern style.

Keep the same architectural shell: walls, windows, doors, trim, ceiling height, flooring, fireplace, and any built-in elements must stay exactly where they are. Do not move walls, add or remove windows, change flooring, or alter architectural features. Do not fix, repaint, patch, or cover any visible cracks, stains, holes, or other damage; these must remain visible.

First, STRIP THE ROOM: remove ALL existing furniture and decor – the current sofa, armchairs, coffee table, side tables, lamps, rugs, artwork, plants, and all personal items – so the room appears completely unfurnished while still showing the true architecture and any visible defects. Even though this room is currently furnished, remove everything.

Then, RE-FURNISH the room completely in a Modern style:

Add a low-profile, boxy sofa in charcoal or white facing the focal wall, sized appropriately for the room.

Add a thin-legged glass or metal coffee table, and one or two accent chairs with clean geometric lines.

Place a bold geometric area rug in black/white or with a single accent color.

Add a minimalist floor lamp with an arc or sculptural design, and a simple table lamp on a slim metal side table.

Include 1–2 pieces of bold, minimal wall art – large scale, abstract, high contrast.

Add one sculptural plant in a modern pot.
All furniture must be properly scaled to the actual room dimensions. Do not use oversized furniture. Leave realistic walkways.

LEVEL THE PHOTO: straighten the image so all verticals are truly vertical. You may adjust camera height slightly. Do not move horizontally, widen the field of view, or make the room appear larger.

Apply professional-level photo enhancement: correct exposure, increase contrast for that sharp modern look, fix white balance, reduce noise. The final result should be a photorealistic, fully staged Modern living room that honestly reflects the true architecture and condition of the property."

EXAMPLE D - Living Room with Built-ins → LUXURY style (demonstrating texture layering, focal points, shelf styling):
"Using this uploaded living room photo, create a fully virtually staged real-estate listing image in a Luxury style.

Keep the same architectural shell: walls, windows, doors, trim, ceiling height, flooring, fireplace, and built-in shelving exactly as they appear. Do not alter any architectural features or fix any visible damage.

First, STRIP THE ROOM: remove all existing furniture, decor, and items on shelves so the room appears unfurnished.

Then, RE-FURNISH in a Luxury style (NOT sterile hotel-lobby beige):

FOCAL POINT: Create a striking focal point at the fireplace - add a large piece of contemporary art above the mantel, and style the mantel with 2-3 sculptural objects in varied heights. Add a beautifully styled coffee table with a curated arrangement (large art book, small sculptural object, fresh greenery).

SEATING: Add a substantial sofa in plush bouclé or velvet (taupe, greige, or soft charcoal) - not generic. Add two accent chairs in a complementary fabric with visible texture. Include throw pillows mixing velvet, linen, and wool in neutral tones plus ONE muted accent color (muted blue-green or warm rust) for character.

RUG: Place a LARGE area rug with sophisticated pattern or visible texture that extends under all seating - front legs of sofa and chairs must be on the rug so furniture reads as one cohesive conversation area.

SHELF STYLING: Style built-in shelves with a CURATED, VARIED mix - books of different heights and muted spine colors, sculptural objects, small plants, 1-2 framed photos. Leave some negative space. NEVER repeat the same object or book stack across shelves.

LIGHTING: Add statement table lamps (brass or sculptural) on side tables, and a floor lamp with visible texture or brass finish.

MICRO-REALISM: Allow subtle natural variation - a throw casually draped with realistic folds, pillows that aren't perfectly rigid.

All furniture must feel substantial and custom. Layer textures so the room feels tactile and lived-in, not flat.

LEVEL THE PHOTO and apply professional enhancement with slightly more contrast for drama. The final result should be a photorealistic, high-end designer living room that feels inviting and luxurious - NOT a sterile hotel lobby."

EXAMPLE E - Dining Room → ARCHITECTURE DIGEST style (demonstrating dramatic lighting + designer furniture):
"Using this uploaded dining room photo, create a fully virtually staged real-estate listing image in an Architecture Digest style.

ARCHITECTURAL PRESERVATION (CRITICAL): Keep the same architectural shell: walls, windows, doors, trim, ceiling height, and flooring exactly as they appear. Do NOT move, add, remove, or resize any windows or doors. Do NOT alter any architectural features. Do NOT fill in doorways or openings. Do NOT fix, repaint, patch, or cover any visible cracks, stains, holes, or other damage - these must remain visible.

First, STRIP THE ROOM: remove all existing furniture and decor so the room appears unfurnished while preserving the exact architecture.

Then, RE-FURNISH in the Architecture Digest style with THREE TRANSFORMATION LAYERS:

LAYER 1 - DRAMATIC LIGHTING (CRITICAL - this is PHOTO ENHANCEMENT, not structural change):
Transform the lighting to golden hour quality - the entire scene should look like 1 hour before sunset. Add visible warm light rays streaming through the EXISTING windows (do not add/move windows). Create rich dimensional shadows in warm brown/amber tones (NOT flat gray). Apply an interior glow effect so the space feels lit from within. Use color temperature 2700K-3000K throughout - absolutely NO cool or blue tones anywhere. All whites become cream/ivory, all shadows become warm amber.

LAYER 2 - DESIGNER STAGING (furniture only, not architectural):
Add a solid light oak dining table with clean lines, surrounded by 6 Hans Wegner wishbone chairs in natural ash.
Place a large natural jute rug with subtle texture under the table.
Add ONE large abstract artwork (at least 36x48 inches) in earth tones (terracotta, sage, cream) with a simple float frame on the main wall.
Include an olive tree (5-6 feet tall) in an aged terracotta pot in the corner as the SIGNATURE element.
Add a brass or ceramic pendant light with warm glow above the table.
Keep the table centerpiece MINIMAL - either empty or a single sculptural vase with olive branches.

LAYER 3 - COLOR GRADING:
Push the entire image warm/golden. Whites = cream (never stark). Shadows = warm brown/amber (never gray). Wood tones = rich honey/amber.

All furniture must be realistically scaled. Do NOT use books as decor in the dining room. Do NOT alter the room's architecture. The walls, windows, doors, and floor must be IDENTICAL to the original photo. The final result should be a photorealistic, magazine-cover quality dining room with dramatic golden-hour lighting that honestly represents the actual space."

EXAMPLE F - Exterior → ARCHITECTURE DIGEST style (demonstrating LIGHTING transformation - NOT structural):
"Using this uploaded exterior photo, create a fully virtually staged real-estate listing image in an Architecture Digest style.

*** CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL PRESERVATION ***
This is a LIGHTING transformation ONLY. The home's structure must remain EXACTLY as photographed:
- Do NOT move, add, remove, or resize ANY windows
- Do NOT alter the home's footprint, roofline, or siding
- Do NOT change the landscaping layout or add/remove trees (you may enhance lighting on existing plants)
- Do NOT fill in or alter any doors, openings, or architectural features
- Every window must remain in its EXACT original position
- The home must be immediately recognizable as the same property

TRANSFORM THE LIGHTING AND ATMOSPHERE with THREE LAYERS:

LAYER 1 - GOLDEN HOUR SKY (LIGHTING CHANGE ONLY):
Transform the sky to a dramatic golden hour gradient: blue at the top transitioning to warm gold in the middle, then pink/peach tones at the horizon. This is the 'magic hour' - 1 hour before sunset.

LAYER 2 - WINDOW GLOW (LIGHTING CHANGE ONLY):
EVERY EXISTING window must show warm amber interior glow - light should be visibly emanating from within the home. This is applied to the windows that ALREADY EXIST - do not add windows or change their positions.

LAYER 3 - LIGHTING ON ARCHITECTURE:
Apply golden side-light to EXISTING trees and landscaping, with warm highlights on foliage. The home's exterior surfaces should catch warm evening light.

ADDED ELEMENTS (decor only, not structural):
Add an olive tree in an aged terracotta pot near the entry (this is portable decor).
If there's a porch, add natural wood or woven outdoor furniture (this is furniture).

COLOR GRADING:
Push the entire image warm. Eliminate any cool/blue tones except in the upper sky. Whites on the home become warm cream in the golden light.

The overall effect should be 'Dwell magazine cover at sunset' quality achieved through LIGHTING AND ATMOSPHERE, not structural changes. The home must be the EXACT SAME home - just photographed at magic hour with beautiful lighting.

LEVEL THE PHOTO so all verticals are truly vertical. The final result should be a photorealistic, magazine-cover quality exterior that honestly represents the actual property."

=============================================================================
⚠️ FINAL STRUCTURAL CHECK (ARCHITECTURE DIGEST) ⚠️
=============================================================================
Before finalizing ANY Architecture Digest image, verify:
✓ All doorways and openings to adjacent rooms are preserved exactly
✓ All windows remain in their exact original positions
✓ All walls remain exactly where they were in the original
✓ No architectural features have been added or removed
✓ If you could see into another room (kitchen, hallway, etc.), that view is still visible
✓ The room is immediately recognizable as the same space from the original photo
