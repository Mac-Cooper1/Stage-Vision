## EXTERIOR - Twilight Transformation

### SKY - The Foundation

**Golden Hour (Primary - Use 70%):**
```
Sky gradient from soft cornflower blue at top through warm golden/amber 
in middle to soft peach/pink at horizon. Wispy clouds catching golden 
light. Sun is below frame or just at horizon - not visible disc.
```

**Blue Hour/Dusk (Use 30%):**
```
Deeper blue sky with pink and purple clouds. More dramatic. Last golden 
glow on horizon. Deep and moody but still warm toned.
```

### WINDOW GLOW - Critical Element
```
EVERY visible window must show warm amber interior light. This is what 
makes exterior shots look editorial. Light should look like warm 
incandescent bulbs (2700K) glowing from within. Windows become beacons 
of warmth against the twilight sky. Vary brightness slightly - some 
brighter (main rooms) some softer (secondary rooms).
```

### SIGNATURE LANDSCAPING
```
Mature olive tree (6-8 ft) in large aged terracotta pot (20-26" diameter) 
positioned near front entry, beside garage, or on porch. This is the 
signature exterior element.

Alternative positions: beside driveway, near front steps, at deck corner.
```

### ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS
```
- String lights (Edison bulb style) on deck or patio areas
- Outdoor furniture: teak or weathered wood with gray or cream cushions
- Large ceramic planters with ornamental grasses
- Pathway uplighting (subtle, warm)
- Potted lavender or olive branches in large terracotta pots flanking entry
```

### LAWN AND LANDSCAPE
```
Enhance lawn to warmer, healthier golden-green tone. Not fake perfect, 
but improved. Trees should catch golden side-light on trunk and foliage. 
Long shadows stretching across lawn. Garden beds should look cared for.
```

### CLEANUP
```
Minimize or remove: power lines, garbage bins, hoses, cars in driveway 
(unless nice), work equipment, visible damage or clutter.
```
